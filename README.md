## Introduction 
**SMART** facilitates fast reactive replanning in dynamic environments. It performs risk-based local tree-pruning if the current path is obstructed by nearby moving obstacle(s), resulting in multiple disjoint subtrees. Then, it exploits these subtrees and performs informed tree-repair at hot-spots that lie at the intersection of subtrees to find a new path.

## Experiment 
The SMART algorithm is validated by real experiments in a 7m by 7m lab space with both static and dynamic obstacles. A robot called ROSMASTER X3 is used that is equipped with 1) a RPLIDAR S2L lidar with a range of 8m for obstacle detection, 2) MD520 motor with encoder for detection of rotation angle and linear displacement, and 3) MPU9250 IMU for detection of speed, acceleration, and orientation. An Extended Kalman Filter is used to fuse data from the IMU and motor encoder for localization.

## Usage

### C++
- **User-defined inputs:**
  - File "Main.cpp": trialIndex, dynObsNum, dynObsSpeed, sceneIndex, dynObsPosition, robotInitState, goalState
  - File "SMART.cpp": cellSize, staticObsMap.txt
```
trialIndex: control the random seed to generate the tree
sceneIndex: control the random seed to generate dynamic obstacle motion
dynObsPosition: initial position of dynamic obstacle
goalState: fixed goal position
robotInitState: initial robot position and speed
cellSize: size of cell in meter
staticObsMap.txt: binary occupancy grid map. free = 0; occupied = 1.
```

- **Outputs:**
  - Replanning time (s)
  - Trajectory length (m)
  - Travel Time (s)
  - Recorded data
    
- **Recorded data:**
  - Dynamic obstacle
  - Tree
  - Path
  - Robot's footprint
```
Function dataRecord() is used to record the data for visualization on Matlab.
```

- **Compilation:**
```
compile Main.cpp
run the executable file
```

### Matlab for visualization:
- **User-defined input:**
  - "folder": It is a character array to store the directory to the folder that contains the recorded data.
  - "videoRecord": A demo video will be created if videoRecord = true.

- **Demo generation:**
```
run Main.m
```
